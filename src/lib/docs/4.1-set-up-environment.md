# Set up environment

Before writing the user interface or connecting to your EML AdminTool, you need a working development environment. This guide will help you set up a basic Electron project with **EML Lib**.

## Install Node.js

EML Lib v2 requires a modern version of Node.js to function correctly. You must install Node.js v20 (LTS) or higher. If you don't have Node.js installed yet, follow the instructions below for your operating system.

<Tabs group="os">
<TabItem label="Windows">

1. Go to the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** installer (v20+).

3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

4. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell and verify the installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output v20.x.x or higher
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="macOS">

1. The easiest way is to use _Homebrew_. If you don't have it, install it: open Terminal and run:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install Node.js:

   ```bash
   brew install node@24
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Node.js v24 is the latest LTS version on macOS as of December 2025. It is fully compatible with EML Lib v2.

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output v24.x.x or higher
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

1. The easiest way is to use `fnm` (_Fast Node Manager_). Install it by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
   source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```
2. Install Node.js:

   ```bash
   fnm install 24
   fnm use 24
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Node.js v24 is the latest LTS version on macOS as of December 2025. It is fully compatible with EML Lib v2.

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output v24.x.x or higher
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize the project

Before building your custom launcher, you need a working development environment. EML Lib provides two ways to get started: using our pre-configured template (recommended for beginners) or setting up the environment manually.

### Option 1: Use the pre-configured template (recommended for beginners)

If you want to focus on the launcher logic and design immediately without configuring Webpack, Vite, or TypeScript manually, use our official starter kit: EML Template.

It comes pre-configured with:
* Vite (ultra-fast build tool)
* TypeScript (type safety)
* SCSS (advanced styling)
* Electron Builder (ready to package)

To get started:

1. Go to the [EML Template](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-Template) repository.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must have Git installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, [download it](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions.
   > 
   > You should also have a GitHub account to create your own copy of the template.

2. Click "Use this template" > "Create a new repository" to create a copy in your own GitHub account.

3. Clone your new repository: 

   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and my-launcher with your repository name
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-launcher.git 
   cd my-launcher
   ```

4. Install dependencies: 

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Change the EML AdminTool URL in `electron/const.ts` to point to your own EML AdminTool instance.

6. Start the developer mode: 

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

You can now start customizing your launcher by following the [Frontend architecture](/docs/frontend-architecture) and further chapters.

### Option 2: Set up the environment manually

<Tabs group="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your development folder.

2. Create a new Vite project using the "Vanilla" template:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-launcher -- --template vanilla
   ```

3. Navigate into the new folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-launcher
   ```

4. Install the initial dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript">

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your development folder.

2. Create a new Vite project using the "Vanilla-TS" template:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-launcher -- --template vanilla-ts
   ```

3. Navigate into the new folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-launcher
   ```

4. Install the initial dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, we need to install Electron, EML Lib, and the tools to bridge Vite and Electron.

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install the core library
npm install eml-lib

# Install Electron, Builder, and Vite plugins as dev dependencies
npm install electron electron-builder vite-plugin-electron --save-dev
```

We now need to configure Vite to work with Electron.

<Tabs group="lang">
<TabItem label="JavaScript">

1. Create (or replace) the `vite.config.js` file at the root of the project:

   ```javascript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
   import electron from 'vite-plugin-electron'

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       electron({
         entry: 'electron/main.js',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

2. Open `package.json` and update the `main` entry and `scripts`. Ensure you remove `"type": "module"` if present.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-launcher",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "main": "dist-electron/main.js",
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite",
       "build": "vite build && electron-builder"
     },
     "author": "Your Name",
     "license": "ISC",
     "dependencies": {
       // Your dependencies here
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       // Your dev dependencies here
     }
   }
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TypeScript">

1. Create (or replace) the `vite.config.ts` file at the root of the project:

   ```typescript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
   import electron from 'vite-plugin-electron'

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       electron({
         entry: 'electron/main.ts',
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

2. Open `package.json` and update the `main` entry and `scripts`. Ensure you remove `"type": "module"` if present.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-launcher",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "main": "dist-electron/main.js",
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "vite",
       "build": "tsc && vite build && electron-builder"
     },
     "author": "Your Name",
     "license": "ISC",
     "dependencies": {
       // Your dependencies here
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       // Your dev dependencies here
     }
   }
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Even in TypeScript, the `main` field in `package.json` must point to the compiled JavaScript file (`dist-electron/main.js`), not your `.ts` source file.
