# Set up NGINX

Your EML AdminTool instance can be accessed directly via its IP address and port (by default, port `8080`). However, it is recommended to set up a reverse proxy using NGINX to enable HTTPS and improve security. It also allows you to access EML AdminTool using a custom domain name and standard ports (`80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS).

We assume you have already installed EML AdminTool by following the [installation guide](2.2-install-eml-admintool.md), and that you have a domaine name pointing to your server's public IP address.

The following tutorial uses NGINX as reverse proxy under Linux. If you prefer to use another web server (such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)), or if you are using a different operating system, please refer to its documentation for setting up a reverse proxy.

## Installation

First, install NGINX on your server.

<Tabs group="os">
<TabItem label="Debian / Ubuntu">

Update your package list and install NGINX using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CentOS / RHEL">

Install NGINX using `dnf` (or `yum` on older versions), then enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

We need to create a configuration file that tells NGINX how to forward traffic to your AdminTool.

<Tabs group="os">
<TabItem label="Debian / Ubuntu">

Create a new file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/eml-admintool
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CentOS / RHEL">

Create a new file in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/eml-admintool.conf
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Paste the following configuration into the file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Multi-domain / IP Configuration:**
> You must adapt the `server_name` directive to match **all** the ways you access your server (e.g., your public domain, your local IP, etc.).
> This should roughly match the entries you defined during the installation script. Separate them with spaces.

```bash
server {
  listen 80;
  
  # REPLACE THIS LINE with your actual domains and IPs
  # Example: server_name panel.myserver.com 192.168.1.50 127.0.0.1;
  server_name YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP;

  location / {
    # Forward traffic to the Docker container on port 8080
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;

    # Allow large file uploads (up to 1GB; adjust as needed)
    client_max_body_size 1G;

    # Timeout settings: uploading large files may take time
    proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    proxy_connect_timeout 300s;
    proxy_send_timeout 300s;

    # Standard headers for proxying
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    # WebSocket support (Required for SvelteKit/Vite HMR in some cases)
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

## Enable and Test

Now, enable the site (for Debian/Ubuntu) and reload NGINX.

<Tabs group="os">
<TabItem label="Debian / Ubuntu">

Create a symbolic link to enable the site:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/eml-admintool /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

Test the configuration for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, reload NGINX:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CentOS / RHEL">

Test the configuration for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the test is successful, reload NGINX:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your AdminTool should now be accessible via `http://YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP` (without the `:8080` port).
