# User settings

The **Account settings** page allows every user (administrators and standard users) to manage their personal profile, update their credentials, and review their assigned permissions.

## Account information

The top section displays your current profile details:

* **Username:** Your display name on the AdminTool.
* **Password:** Hidden for security reasons.
* **Account type:** Indicates if you are the _Administrator_ or a _Standard_ user.

### Editing your profile

To modify your information, hover over the section and click on the "Edit" button (<i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i>).

* **Username:** You can change your username here.
  > [!WARNING]
  > **For the administrator:**
  > If you are the administrator, changing your username will also change the global name of the EML AdminTool. These two values are linked.

* **Password:** To change your password, enter the new password in both the "New password" and "Confirm password" fields.
  > [!TIP]
  > If you only want to change your username but keep your current password, simply leave the password fields blank.

Click "Save" to apply changes. You may be asked to log in again if you changed your credentials.

## Permissions

This section is read-only. It displays the list of features you are allowed to access and manage.

These permissions are assigned by the administrator when your account is approved. If you need access to a specific feature (like _Files Updater_ or _News_ management) but do not see it listed here, you must contact the administrator to update your rights.
   
## Danger zone

* **Delete account:** This button allows you to permanently delete your own account.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > This action is **irreversible**. You will lose access to the AdminTool immediately. If you wish to return, you will need to register again and wait for administrator approval.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The main Administrator cannot delete their own account from here. To reset the main account, a full factory reset of the AdminTool is required (see [General settings](#3.1-general-settings)).
