# General settings

The **Settings** page is the command center of your EML AdminTool. From here, you can manage the identity of your panel, monitor your server's health, manage updates, and most importantly, control who has access to your launcher configuration.

## Global information

The top section displays the current identity of your AdminTool. Hover over the section and click on the "Edit" button (<i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i>) to modify these values.

![Edit AdminTool information modal](/images/general-settings-info.png)

* **Name:** This is the global name of your AdminTool instance (e.g., "MyServer Admin").
  > [!WARNING]
  > Changing the AdminTool name also changes the username used for the main administrator account. If you change "MyServer" to "NewProject", you will need to log in as "NewProject" next time.

* **Language:** Select the interface language (English, French, German, Italian, Danish, Japanese).

* **PIN code:** This is a security code used for registration (more below).

### User management

Security is paramount. The EML AdminTool uses a "Request & Approve" system for new users.

#### The registration flow

1. You give the PIN code to a new staff member.
2. They go to the AdminTool login page and select "Create an account".
3. They enter the PIN and their desired username.
4. They appear in your dashboard under the "Pending users" list.

> [!NOTE]
> In all cases, new users can log in _before_ being approved, but they have **no permissions** and cannot do anything until you approve them. Moreover, if the PIN code is incorrect, the user will not be informed, and they will appear in the "Wrong-PIN users" list instead.

#### Approving a user

When a user is in the "Pending" list, click the check button (<i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>) to review their request. You will be presented with a permission modal.

You must explicitly grant permissions to define what they can do:

| Permission        | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Files Updater** | This option gives access to uploading, editing, and deleting game files (mods, configs). This is the key permission for managing game content that the launcher uses. |
| **Bootstraps**    | Launcher includes a automatic update system called "Bootstraps". This permission allows managing these bootstraps by changing the install files.                      |
| **Maintenance**   | Allows toggling the maintenance mode to lock launcher access.                                                                                                         |
| **News**          | This option gives access to managing the news feed, including adding, deleting, and managing categories and tags.                                                     |
| **Backgrounds**   | Allows changing the launcher's background images.                                                                                                                     |

Once you click "Save", the user can log in.

If you do not want to approve the user, click the cross button (<i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i>) to delete their request. The user will be moved to the "Deleted users" list.

#### Managing existing users

Click on any existing user to see their permissions. To modify them, click the "Edit" button (<i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i>), change the permissions, and click "Save".

To delete an existing user, click the trash button (<i class="fa-solid fa-trash"></i>) next to their name. This action is irreversible, but the user information and data (such as news) are kept, and the user is moved to the "Deleted users" list.

#### Deleting users

Users in the "Deleted users" or "Wrong-PIN users" lists can be permanently removed by clicking the trash button (<i class="fa-solid fa-trash"></i>) next to their name. This action is irreversible, and all their data (news, etc.) will be permanently deleted.

## Update and system status

This section provides a quick overview of your infrastructure health.

* **Update:** Checks if a new version of the EML AdminTool is available. If so, a button appears to install the update.
  > [!WARNING]
  > Always read the release notes before updating. Some updates may require manual steps.

* **VPS & Docker:**
  * **Docker Information:** Displays the underlying OS kernel version.
  * **Storage:** Shows the disk usage of the Docker container.
  > [!TIP]
  > Keep an eye on the storage bar. Modpacks and assets can be heavy. If it reaches 100%, you won't be able to upload new files.

## Danger Zone

* **Reset EML AdminTool:** This button performs a complete factory reset of the database.
  > [!CAUTION]
  > This action is **irreversible**. It will delete all users, all news, and all configurations. Only use this if you want to start fresh.

## Advanced — Changing domain or IP

If you move your EML AdminTool to a new server, if you switch from a local IP to a public domain name, or if you change your domain, you must update the configuration manually.

The AdminTool protects itself against _Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)_ by strictly validating the origin of the connection. If the domain doesn't match the configuration, you will be unable to log in.

**How to update the configuration:**

1. Connect to your server via SSH.

2. Navigate to your installation directory (default is `~/.eml/admintool`).

3. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```
  
4. Update the `ORIGIN` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` variables:
   ```bash
   # EML AdminTool Environment Configuration
   NODE_ENV=production
   ORIGIN=<MAIN DOMAIN, SEE BELOW>
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,http://127.0.0.1:8080,http://<your-local-ip>:8080,http://<your-public-ip>:8080,http://<your-domain>,https://<your-domain>
   ```

   Replace `<MAIN DOMAIN, SEE BELOW>` with the main domain you will use to access EML AdminTool:

   - If you plan to access EML AdminTool using a domain name and HTTPS later, enter the domain with format `https://<your-domain>` (for example, `https://at.emlproject.pages.dev`). This is the recommended option.

   - if you plan to access EML AdminTool using a domain name but **without** HTTPS later, enter the domain with format `http://<your-domain>` (for example, `http://at.emlproject.pages.dev`).

   - If you do not have a domain name, enter the public IP address of your VPS with format `http://<your-public-ip>:8080` (for example, `http://104.21.22.180:8080`).

   - If you only want to access EML AdminTool on your local network, enter your local IP address with format `http://<your-local-ip>:8080` (for example, `http://192.168.1.100:8080`).

   - If you only want to access EML AdminTool on your computer, enter `http://localhost:8080`.

   Replace `<your-local-ip>`, `<your-public-ip>`, and `<your-domain>` in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` variable with the appropriate values (you can remove any value you don't need, or add others). It is recommended to keep both `http` and `https` versions of your domain if you plan to use HTTPS later.


5. Save the file and exit.

6. Restart the application to apply changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

Your AdminTool is now configured to accept connections from the new domain.
