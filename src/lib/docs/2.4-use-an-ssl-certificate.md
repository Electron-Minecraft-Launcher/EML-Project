# Use an SSL certificate

Now that NGINX is handling the traffic, we need to secure the connection with HTTPS using a free certificate from **Let's Encrypt**.

> [!WARNING]
> **Domain Requirement:**
> You **must** have a valid domain name (e.g., `at.emlproject.pages.dev`) pointing to your server's public IP.
> Let's Encrypt **does not** support raw IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.50`). If you access your EML AdminTool via an IP, it will remain in HTTP or raise security warnings.

## Install Certbot

Certbot is the official tool to obtain Let's Encrypt certificates.

<Tabs group="os">
<TabItem label="Debian / Ubuntu">

Install Certbot and its NGINX plugin:

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CentOS / RHEL">

First, ensure the EPEL repository is enabled (often required for Certbot), then install:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y epel-release
sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Obtain and configure the certificate

Certbot will read your NGINX configuration, validate your domain, and automatically update the NGINX file to enable HTTPS.

Run the following command:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Follow the interactive instructions:
1. **Enter email:** Used for urgent renewal and security notices.
2. **Terms of Service:** Agree to them.
3. **Select Domains:** Certbot will list the domains found in your `server_name` directive (from the previous step).
   * **Select ONLY your domain name(s)** (e.g., `at.emlproject.pages.dev`).
   * **Do NOT select IP addresses** (e.g., `192.168.1.50`), as the validation will fail for them.
4. **Redirect:** If asked, choose to **Redirect** HTTP traffic to HTTPS (recommended).

## Verify auto-renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Certbot installs a timer to renew them automatically. You can verify it works with a dry run:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

Your AdminTool is now secure and accessible via `https://at.emlproject.pages.dev`.
