# Get Docker

You need to install Docker Engine and Docker Compose on your VPS. The following steps will guide you through the installation process.

For production environments, it is recommended to use a Linux-based operating system (for example, Ubuntu or Debian). To install Docker on macOS or Windows, please see the instructions below.

<small>The following is taken from the official Docker documentation, under Apache License 2.0.</small>

## Install Docker under Linux

<!-- TABS:START -->

<!-- TABNAME:Debian -->

### Prerequisites

#### Firewall limitations

> [!WARNING]
>
> Before you install Docker, make sure you consider the following
> security implications and firewall incompatibilities.

- If you use ufw or firewalld to manage firewall settings, be aware that
  when you expose container ports using Docker, these ports bypass your
  firewall rules. For more information, refer to
  [Docker and ufw](/manuals/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls.md#docker-and-ufw).
- Docker is only compatible with `iptables-nft` and `iptables-legacy`.
  Firewall rules created with `nft` are not supported on a system with Docker installed.
  Make sure that any firewall rulesets you use are created with `iptables` or `ip6tables`,
  and that you add them to the `DOCKER-USER` chain,
  see [Packet filtering and firewalls](/manuals/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls.md).

#### OS requirements

To install Docker Engine, you need one of these Debian versions:

- Debian Trixie 13 (stable)
- Debian Bookworm 12 (oldstable)
- Debian Bullseye 11 (oldoldstable)

Docker Engine for Debian is compatible with x86_64 (or amd64), armhf (arm/v7),
arm64, and ppc64le (ppc64el) architectures.

#### Uninstall old versions

Before you can install Docker Engine, you need to uninstall any conflicting packages.

Your Linux distribution may provide unofficial Docker packages, which may conflict
with the official packages provided by Docker. You must uninstall these packages
before you install the official version of Docker Engine.

The unofficial packages to uninstall are:

- `docker.io`
- `docker-compose`
- `docker-doc`
- `podman-docker`

Moreover, Docker Engine depends on `containerd` and `runc`. Docker Engine
bundles these dependencies as one bundle: `containerd.io`. If you have
installed the `containerd` or `runc` previously, uninstall them to avoid
conflicts with the versions bundled with Docker Engine.

Run the following command to uninstall all conflicting packages:

```console
$ sudo apt remove $(dpkg --get-selections docker.io docker-compose docker-doc podman-docker containerd runc | cut -f1)
```

`apt` might report that you have none of these packages installed.

Images, containers, volumes, and networks stored in `/var/lib/docker/` aren't
automatically removed when you uninstall Docker. If you want to start with a
clean installation, and prefer to clean up any existing data, read the
[uninstall Docker Engine](#uninstall-docker-engine) section.

### Installation

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you
need to set up the Docker `apt` repository. Afterward, you can install and update
Docker from the repository.

#### Set up Docker's `apt` repository

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL {{% param "download-url-base" %}}/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.sources <<EOF
Types: deb
URIs: {{% param "download-url-base" %}}
Suites: $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
Components: stable
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
EOF

sudo apt update
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you use a derivative distribution, such as Kali Linux,
> you may need to substitute the part of this command that's expected to
> print the version codename:
>
> ```console
> $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")
> ```
>
> Replace this part with the codename of the corresponding Debian release,
> such as `bookworm`.

#### Install the Docker packages

To install the latest version, run:

```console
$ sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The Docker service starts automatically after installation. To verify that
> Docker is running, use:
>
> ```console
> $ sudo systemctl status docker
> ```
>
> Some systems may have this behavior disabled and will require a manual start:
>
> ```console
> $ sudo systemctl start docker
> ```

#### Verify that the installation is successful by running the `hello-world` image

```console
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the
container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine.

<!-- TABNAME:Ubuntu -->

<!-- TABNAME:REHL -->

### Prerequisites

#### OS requirements

To install Docker Engine, you need a maintained version of one of the following
RHEL versions:

- RHEL 8
- RHEL 9
- RHEL 10

#### Uninstall old versions

Before you can install Docker Engine, you need to uninstall any conflicting packages.

Your Linux distribution may provide unofficial Docker packages, which may conflict
with the official packages provided by Docker. You must uninstall these packages
before you install the official version of Docker Engine.

```console
$ sudo dnf remove docker \
                  docker-client \
                  docker-client-latest \
                  docker-common \
                  docker-latest \
                  docker-latest-logrotate \
                  docker-logrotate \
                  docker-engine \
                  podman \
                  runc
```

`dnf` might report that you have none of these packages installed.

Images, containers, volumes, and networks stored in `/var/lib/docker/` aren't
automatically removed when you uninstall Docker.

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you
need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update
Docker from the repository.

### Installation

#### Set up the repository

Install the `dnf-plugins-core` package (which provides the commands to manage
your DNF repositories) and set up the repository.

```console
$ sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo {{% param "download-url-base" %}}/docker-ce.repo
```

#### Install the Docker packages

To install the latest version, run:

```console
$ sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

If prompted to accept the GPG key, verify that the fingerprint matches
`060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35`, and if so, accept it.

This command installs Docker, but it doesn't start Docker. It also creates a
`docker` group, however, it doesn't add any users to the group by default.

#### Start Docker Engine

```console
$ sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

This configures the Docker systemd service to start automatically when you
boot your system. If you don't want Docker to start automatically, use `sudo
   systemctl start docker` instead.

#### Verify that the installation is successful by running the `hello-world` image

```console
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the
container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

You have now successfully installed and started Docker Engine.

<!-- TABNAME:CentOS -->

### Prerequisites

#### OS requirements

To install Docker Engine, you need a maintained version of one of the following
CentOS versions:

3. Double-click `Docker.app` in the **Applications** folder to start Docker.

4. The Docker menu displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.

   Here’s a summary of the key points:

   - Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
   - Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
   - Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
   - Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.

5. Select **Accept** to continue.

   Note that Docker Desktop won't run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

   For more information, see [Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement). It is recommended that you also read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq).

6. From the installation window, select either:

   - **Use recommended settings (Requires password)**. This lets Docker Desktop automatically set the necessary configuration settings.
   - **Use advanced settings**. You can then set the location of the Docker CLI tools either in the system or user directory, enable the default Docker socket, and enable privileged port mapping. See [Settings](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/#advanced), for more information and how to set the location of the Docker CLI tools.

7. Select **Finish**. If you have applied any of the previous configurations that require a password in step 6, enter your password to confirm your choice.

## Install Docker under Windows

### System requirements

> [!TIP]
>
> **Should I use Hyper-V or WSL?**

> Windows containers are not supported.

<!-- TABS:END -->

Containers and images created with Docker Desktop are shared between all
user accounts on machines where it is installed. This is because all Windows
accounts use the same VM to build and run containers. Note that it is not possible to share containers and images between user accounts when using the Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend.

Running Docker Desktop inside a VMware ESXi or Azure VM is supported for Docker Business customers.
It requires enabling nested virtualization on the hypervisor first.
For more information, see [Running Docker Desktop in a VM or VDI environment](/manuals/desktop/setup/vm-vdi.md).

### Administrator privileges and installation requirements

Installing Docker Desktop requires administrator privileges. However, once installed, it can be used without administrative access. Some actions, though, still need elevated permissions. See [Understand permission requirements for Windows](./windows-permission-requirements.md) for more detail.

If your users do not have administrator rights and plan to perform operations that require elevated privileges, be sure to install Docker Desktop using the `--always-run-service` installer flag. This ensures those actions can still be executed without prompting for User Account Control (UAC) elevation. See [Installer Flags](#installer-flags) for more detail.

### WSL: Verification and setup

If you have chosen to use WSL, first verify that your installed version meets system requirements by running the following command in your terminal:

```console
wsl --version
```

If version details do not appear, you are likely using the inbox version of WSL. This version does not support modern capabilities and must be updated.

You can update or install WSL using one of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Install or update WSL via the terminal

1. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode.
2. Run either the install or update command. You may be prompted to restart your machine. For more information, refer to [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

```console
wsl --install

wsl --update
```

#### Option 2: Install WSL via the MSI package

If Microsoft Store access is blocked due to security policies:

1. Go to the official [WSL GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases).
2. Download the `.msi` installer from the latest stable release (under the Assets drop-down).
3. Run the downloaded installer and follow the setup instructions.

### Install Docker Desktop on Windows

> [!TIP]
>
> See the [FAQs](/manuals/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/faqs/general.md#how-do-i-run-docker-desktop-without-administrator-privileges) on how to install and run Docker Desktop without needing administrator privileges.

1. Download the installer using the download button at the top of the page, or from the [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/).

2. Double-click `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` to run the installer. By default, Docker Desktop is installed at `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker`.

3. When prompted, ensure the **Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V** option on the Configuration page is selected or not depending on your choice of backend.

   On systems that support only one backend, Docker Desktop automatically selects the available option.

4. Follow the instructions on the installation wizard to authorize the installer and proceed with the installation.

5. When the installation is successful, select **Close** to complete the installation process.

6. Start Docker Desktop (see below).

If your administrator account is different to your user account, you must add the user to the **docker-users** group to access features that require higher privileges, such as creating and managing the Hyper-V VM, or using Windows containers:

1. Run **Computer Management** as an **administrator**.
2. Navigate to **Local Users and Groups** > **Groups** > **docker-users**.
3. Right-click to add the user to the group.
4. Sign out and sign back in for the changes to take effect.

### Start Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop does not start automatically after installation. To start Docker Desktop:

1. Search for Docker, and select **Docker Desktop** in the search results.

2. The Docker menu displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.

   Here’s a summary of the key points:

   - Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
   - Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
   - Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
   - Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.

3. Select **Accept** to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

   Note that Docker Desktop won't run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

   For more information, see [Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement/). It is recommended that you read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq).
