# Install EML AdminTool

## Installation

To install EML AdminTool, run the following commands:

- with `wget`:
  ```bash
  wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool-v2/main/.github/scripts/eml-admintool@2.0.0-beta.3 | bash
  ```
- with `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool-v2/main/.github/scripts/eml-admintool@2.0.0-beta.3 | bash
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> The script will install EML AdminTool v2.0.0-beta.3. If you want to install a different version, replace `@2.0.0-beta.3` with the desired version tag.

EML AdminTool is now available at `http://localhost:8080/` from your VPS or `http://<your-vps-ip-address>:8080/` from any computer. For the moment, we recommend using it only on your local network, as it is not set up and secured with HTTPS yet.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, EML AdminTool is not secured: anyone who knows the URL can access it and set up the admin account. Make sure to set up EML AdminTool on a private network, or use a firewall to restrict access to it (or at least, configure EML AdminTool very quickly).

## Setup

To set up EML AdminTool, you need to use a computer with a web browser.

Open the EML AdminTool web interface by navigating to `http://<your-vps-ip-address>:3000/` in your web browser. You should be automatically redirected to the setup page.

### Step 1: Choose language

Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu. EML AdminTool supports multiple languages, and you can change it later in the settings.

If your language is not available, you can contribute to the translation by following [this guide](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool-v2?tab=readme-ov-file#translation).

### Step 2: Generate a database password

On the second step, you need to generate a database password. This password will be used to connect EML AdminTool to its database. You don't need to remember this password, as it will be stored securely in the configuration file.

Usually, you should use the "Generate" button to create a strong password. However, in some (rare) cases, you might want to access the database directly, for example, to run queries or backups. In this case, you can enter your own password. Make sure to remember it, as you will need it later.

## Step 3: Create an admin account

On the third step, you need to create an admin account. This account will be used to manage EML AdminTool settings and other users. The admin account username will also be used to name your EML AdminTool instance: very often, it will be the same as your **Minecraft Server name**.

You can now log in to EML AdminTool using the admin account you just created.
