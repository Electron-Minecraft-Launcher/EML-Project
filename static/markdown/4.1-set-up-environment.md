# Set up environment

Before writing the user interface or connecting to your AdminTool, you need a working development environment. This guide will help you set up a basic Electron project with **EML Lib**.

## Install Node.js

EML Lib v2 requires a modern version of Node.js to function correctly. You must install **Node.js v20 (LTS)** or higher. If you don't have Node.js installed yet, follow the instructions below for your operating system.

<!-- TABS:START -->

<!-- TABNAME:Windows -->

1. Go to the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** installer (v20+).

3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

4. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell and verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output v20.x.x or higher
   ```

<!-- TABNAME:macOS -->

1. The easiest way is to use _Homebrew_. If you don't have it, install it: open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Install Node.js:
   ```bash
   brew install node@24
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Node.js v24 is the latest LTS version on macOS as of December 2025. It is fully compatible with EML Lib v2.

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output v24.x.x or higher
   ```

<!-- TABNAME:Linux -->

1. The easiest way is to use `fnm` (_Fast Node Manager_). Install it by running the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
   source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```
2. Install Node.js:
   ```bash
   fnm install 24
   fnm use 24
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Node.js v24 is the latest LTS version on macOS as of December 2025. It is fully compatible with EML Lib v2.

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   # Should output v24.x.x or higher
   ```

<!-- TABS:END -->

## Initialize the project

We will create a standard Electron project.

1. Create a new folder for your launcher (e.g., `my-launcher`) and open it in your terminal.

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Open the newly created `package.json` file and modify/add the following lines to configure the entry point:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-launcher",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "main": "main.js",
     "scripts": {
       "start": "electron ."
     },
     "author": "Your Name",
     "license": "ISC"
   }
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > If you are comfortable with JavaScript, don't hesitate to use TypeScript for better type safety and autocompletion (EML Lib is fully compatible with TypeScript). You will need to set up a TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) and adjust the project accordingly.

## Install dependencies

Now we need to install Electron (the framework), EML Lib (the game engine), and Electron Builder (to package the app later).

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Install the core library
npm install eml-lib

# Install Electron and Builder as development dependencies
npm install electron electron-builder --save-dev
```
