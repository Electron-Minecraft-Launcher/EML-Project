# Backgrounds

The **Backgrounds** feature allows you to customize the visual appearance of your launcher. You can upload multiple images and choose which one is currently displayed to your players.

## Managing Backgrounds

The main page displays a gallery of all your uploaded backgrounds. The currently active background is highlighted with a colored border. 

### Uploading a Background

To add a new image to your collection, hover over the section and click the upload button (<i class="fa-solid fa-file-arrow-up"></i>).

* **Name:** Enter a descriptive name for your background (e.g., "Christmas Event", "Default").

* **File:** Click "Select a file..." to choose an image from your computer.

* **Status:** You can choose to set it as active immediately (this will disable the current one).

### Activating a Background

You can have multiple backgrounds stored, but only one can be active at a time.

To switch the active background:
1. Hover over the background you want to use.
2. Click the "Enable" button.
3. The previously active background will automatically be disabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The system requires at least one active background to function correctly. You cannot disable the currently active background without enabling another one first.

### Editing and deleting

**To edit:**
Hover over a background card and click the edit button (<i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i>). You can change its name and status (active/inactive).

**To delete:**
Hover over a background card and click the delete button (<i class="fa-solid fa-trash"></i>).

> [!WARNING]
> You typically cannot delete the background that is currently active. You must activate another one first.
