# Packaging (Electron-Builder)

> [!TIP]
> The _Launcher customization_ section guides you through building a complete Launcher using EML Lib with a custom user interface. The launcher built in this tutorial is available as an open-source TypeScript project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-Template) under MIT license. This is still a very basic example meant to get you started quickly. Do not hesitate to modify and expand it to fit your needs!
