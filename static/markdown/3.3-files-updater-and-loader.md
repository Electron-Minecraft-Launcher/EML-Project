# Files Updater and Loader

The **Files Updater** is the heart of your launcher's content management. This is where you decide exactly what your players will download and run. It handles both game content (mods, configs, resource packs) and the game engine (loader).

## File Updater

### Overview

Files Updater is like a file manager. It allows you to upload files and folders, which will then be downloaded by players' Launchers: when you upload, modify or delete files here, the changes will be reflected on the players' side the next time they launch or sync their game.

> [!NOTE]
> The root folder displayed here corresponds exactly to the installation folder on the player's computer (often `.yourserver`).

Files Updater enables you to create, upload, rename and delete files and folders. You can also edit some files directly in the browser, which is useful for small changes.

> [!WARNING]
> You must not upload any `minecraft.jar`, `version.jar` or `version.json`, neither `assets` or `libraries` folders, as this will be handled by the "Loader" feature (see below).

> [!TIP]
> You can also _drag and drop_ files directly from your computer into the file browser area to upload them instantly.

### Best Practices

#### Recommended Structure

To ensure your modpack works correctly, follow the standard Minecraft folder structure:

```text
/ (root)
├── mods/               <-- Put your .jar mods here
├── config/             <-- Put configuration files here
├── resourcepacks/      <-- Put .zip resource packs here
├── shaderpacks/        <-- (Optional) For shaders
└── options.txt         <-- (Optional) To force default keybinds/video settings
```

#### What NOT to upload

Avoid uploading heavy or unnecessary files that change frequently or are specific to your session:
* `logs/`
* `saves/` (unless you want to distribute a pre-made map)
* `screenshots/`
* `usercache.json` or `usernamecache.json`

#### Handling `options.txt`

If you upload an `options.txt`, it will overwrite the players' settings (video settings, controls, sensitivity) every time the launcher syncs.
* **Initial Setup:** It is good to upload it once to set default keybinds.
* **Updates:** Be careful not to annoy players by resetting their volume or controls constantly.

## Minecraft Loader Settings

After managing files, you must define how the game starts. This section, located at the bottom of the page, controls the game version and the modding engine.

To change these settings, hover over the section and click the edit button (<i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis"></i>).

Then you can modify the following options:
* **Loader:** Choose the modding API you want to use:
  * **Vanilla:** Standard Minecraft without mods.
  * **Forge:** The classic mod loader.
  * Fabric, Quild, NeoForge and MCP version will be added soon.
* **Minecraft version:** The version of the game (e.g., `1.20.1`).
* **Loader Version:** The specific version of Forge/Vanilla to use (usually the latest stable version recommended).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you change the Loader settings and click "Save", the EML AdminTool automatically updates the manifest. Next time players launch their game, it will automatically download the new necessary libraries (JARs) for the selected version.
